### Location

In the [Industrial Park](Industrial-Park).

### Description

The Zoo is the veterinary hospital for Meany animals. In the Zoo, the [veterinarians](Mechanic) administer the copious amounts of TLC needed to keep them going. Since the Zoo is only big enough for one critter at a time, the [Machines](Machines) take turns breaking down. If you believe that one, we've got a Tom Cat differential we'd like to sell you.

### History

#### 1984

Bulldozed area behind the [Cat House](Cat-House) to make a larger industrial area, losing [Kitchen Jump](Kitchen-Jump) in the process. <sup>[nw][]</sup>

#### 1993

Construction of the Zoo was led by [Mike Lonergan](Mike-Lonergan). The field work was completed in the fall of 1993 with a tracked loader and a backhoe. The building construction started on October 1st and was fully enclosed by the November work party. <sup>[wp93][]</sup>

Now that I dig through old notes, I believe the floor has welded wire mesh--I have no idea on gauge or spacing.  We did not have the money for rebar, we did not have the labor units to tie rebar, and we did not have a good way of transporting long loads. --[Mike Lonergan](Mike-Lonergan), May 2020
