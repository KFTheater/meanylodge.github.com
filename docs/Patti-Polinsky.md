### History

#### 1977

A highlight of the season was the Carnival weekend, which featured a "European Feast" complete with bratwurst, German hot potato salad, European pastries and homemade pretzels, in addition to the skiing events-all masterminded by Patti Polinsky. That was the weekend which saw record crowds. <sup>[ma77][]</sup>

#### 1978

**50th Birthday Party**: Patti Polinsky took charge of the elaborate, perfectly-prepared, and very efficiently served salmon dinner. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

A highlight of the ski season was the carnival weekend which featured many corny contests and crazy races, a clowns contest, and a "European Feast" complete with German hot potato salad and homemade European pastries, pretzels, and breadsticks. Many fancy relish trays with elaborate flowered vegetable "nibblies" and apple swans served from an outdoor snow table is an example of how embellished and painstaking the carnival events were. This fantastic weekend was masterminded by Patti Polinsky. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1979

The Annual Spring Carnival was again a superb event as masterminded by Patti Polinsky. In addition to skiing events there were corny contests and crazy races, a clowns contest, and a "European Feast" complete with German hot potato salad and homemade European pastries, pretzels, and breadsticks. <sup>[ma79][]</sup>

#### 1982

Record crowds were drawn to Meany Ski Hut this season by plentiful snow, fantastic skiing, terrific ski lessons with capacity classes taught by Patti Polinsky, Dave Claar and Kim Nelson. <sup>[ma82][]</sup>

#### late 90s

[Norm Vigus](Norm-Vigus) begins instructing at Meany. "Patti was definitely a bonus in my early instruction efforts and I've enjoyed the relationship ever since.  I hope I can last as long as she does instructing at Meany."

#### 2020

I'm a ski INSTRUCTOR because of Patti.  Because Patti encouraged me to take responsibility for the pre-and-early teens, the mostly mindless adolescent boys after they graduated from her class, to actually imagine that I might have something to give them.  And then later, to connect me with the Olympic Ski School for my first experience with a "standard" ski program, and then with Ski Masters so I could get my Level 1 certification, and then with the bigger world of PSIA-NW that eventually lead me to the Summit Snowsport School, and that's how I became a ski instructor.  And by becoming an instructor, I became a skier, instead of the wannabe who could somehow get down the steep stuff without crashing and burning -- too much.  Because the best way to learn is to teach.  Which I learned from Patti. -- [Dan Nord](Dan-Nord)
