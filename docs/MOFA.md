# MOFA

Mountaineer Oriented First Aid course.

### History

#### 1987

MOFA weekend first aid course was filled to capacity and will be expanded in '88.

#### 1990

Another innovation at Meany has been the introduction of MOFA classes. The entire MOFA course, practical exam and CPR are offered during two very full weekends at the lodge. Students have given the class rave reviews and seem to appreciate the chance to have their practicals in such a remote and realistic location.<sup>[ma83][]</sup>
