### History

#### 1978

[Fred Ball](Fred-Ball), an energetic 81-year-old and the 1932 Hut Chairman, entertained the group by singing "Wild Bill Maxwell," a tale written by Art Winder in the 1930's about one of the best-loved and most colorful of Meany's early skiers. Much credit was given to "Max" for organizing the backbreaking labor necessary for building the Hut and clearing the [Lane](Lane). Maxwell's widow, Opal, proudly beamed in the audience as "Max's" story was told in song.<sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1998

Slalom and downhill races for men began that same year, with trophies donated by [Bob Hayes](Robert-Hayes) and Bill Maxwell. Maxwell, with a nickname of "Wild Bill" earned in part by his skiing technique, competed in the first race for the trophy he sponsored-and came in dead last. <sup>[Life At Meany](Life-At-Meany-Ski-Hut)</sup>
