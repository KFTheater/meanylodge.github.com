#### 1939

#### 1949

Installed new propane range in kitchen. This replaced coal-fired range upon which 25 years of cooks have suffered.<sup>[ma78][], [hw][]</sup>

#### 1978

In September 1978 a gigantic Wolf gas kitchen range with two large ovens was somehow hauled into Meany's kitchen.<sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1987

Revise kitchen, added fire prevention sheeting, revise plumbing, move range from west wall to south wall, moved hot water tanks to under counter.<sup>[hw][]</sup>

A major remodeling of the Meany kitchen was started at the July weeklong work party and finished this fall. New cupboards and counter spaces were built. The huge cook stove was relocated on the window side of the kitchen. Another window was built. With the two windows and an added ventilation system, Meany's kitchen air is much sweeter, less humid, and more temperate.<sup>[hr][]</sup>

Crews redid the plumbing for the new sinks and relocated the water heaters. Ray Nelson fabricated an extensive copper tubing utensil rack above the kitchen island and shaped the soap rack above the new sinks.
