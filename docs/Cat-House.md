In the [Industrial Park](Industrial-Park).

### Origin

A small building appeared as if my magic at south side of industrial area in about 1980. The first floor was a shop for repair and overhaul of [Tom Cat](Tom-Cat) and [Pack Rat](Pack-Rat), both equipped tractors. Hence the name, Cat House. The committee resisted the idea of placing a red light over the door. <sup>[nw][]</sup>
