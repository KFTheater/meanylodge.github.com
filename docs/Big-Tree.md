At the top of [South Slobbovia](South-Slobbovia) they left a tree. This is one of the few things at Meany with a logical name.<sup>[n9][]</sup>

### History

#### 2020

The [Meany Map][map] on the wall shows Big Tree as being next to the coatrack. I think the 2009 names located this incorrectly. What big tree exists on South? Surely they aren't referring to [Lower Slobbovia National Park][lsnp].
