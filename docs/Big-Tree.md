At the top of [South Slobbovia](South-Slobbovia) they left a tree. This is one of the few things at Meany with a logical name.

### Editor's Note

As of 2020, the Meany map on the wall shows Big Tree as being next to the coatrack. I think the 2009 names located this incorrectly. What big tree exists on South? Surely they aren't referring to [Lower Slobbovia National Park](Lower-Slobbovia-National-Park).
