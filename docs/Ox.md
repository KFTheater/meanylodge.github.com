During work party season, Meany women took charge of the "Ox" and the two hill "brush" saws. Thanks to the gals, the whole lane, from top to bottom, had been brushed. This took two year to do but it is now skiable on six inches of snow! The ladies on the "Ox" lifted and hauled firewood, propane tanks, giant pumpkins, dozens of mattresses, Cat ski boxes, tractor treads, brush, garbage, you name it. Meanwhile, Meany men overhauled both tractors (Sno-cats). <sup>[hr][]</sup>

#### 1988
