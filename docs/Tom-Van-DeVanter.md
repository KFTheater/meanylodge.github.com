### History

#### 1977

The Snow Tractor was renamed to [Tom Cat](Tom-Cat) in Tom's honor, since he had driven it since the beginning.

#### 1978

"Times were really gloomy at Meany in early 1960," Doug Damm, Hut [Chair](Chair) at that time, recounted. "The trains stopped in March, 1960 and the rest of that season supplies had to be hand-carried all the way from the highway." Doug hilariously told the story of a test run behind Tom Van DeVanter's station wagon to determine how people would react to being towed in by the Cat on ropes. Apparently after a speedy start, a little panic, and a frantic call to "STOP," Tom applied the brakes and the skiers all plowed into his open tailgate. <sup>[htt][]</sup>

### 1984

The Bombardier Snow Tractor used to haul everything three miles from I-90 to Meany. Bought in 1960, when the NPRR discontinued passenger train service. Tom Van Devanter has driven it since the beginning; hence the name "Tom Cat." <sup>[hw][]</sup>
