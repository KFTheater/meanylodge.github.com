#### 1982

The Spring Carnival has an Austrian flavor as Patti Polinsky masterminded "zillertal" activities. This enormous undertaking included a hill-wide scavenger hunt, snow golfing, bow and arrow rivalry, a been carry, slow slalom course, Frisbee toss, snake follow, inner-tube run, kids "costume" parade, an authentic Austrian dinner, a huge "Konditorei" pastry table, a lavish luncheon completer with fancy vegetable nibbles and homemade breadsticks and pretzels and a "lively" folk dance stimulated by Meany's gifted Musicians.
