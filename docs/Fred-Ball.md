### History

#### 1963

I came to Seattle in November, 1927...During these years members branched out from the Lodge and Meany more and more when snow conditions were good as their proficiency increased...Also during this time the route from the Lodge to Meany was pioneered and then marked by orange tin shingles high on trees. This became a popular, if rugged, trip for the more hardy skiers.

#### 1978

[Fred Ball](Fred-Ball), an energetic 81-year-old and the 1932 Hut Chairman, entertained the group by singing "Wild Bill Maxwell," a tale written by Art Winder in the 1930's about one of the best-loved and most colorful of Meany's early skiers.
