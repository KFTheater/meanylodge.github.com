- 2003


#### Pack Rat

This Thiokol snow tractor was scrounged up cheaply from BPA in 1977 for hill packing. It his now used as auxiliary transportation when [Tom Cat](Tom-Cat) is ailing or its load is too much. On ski lesson days it becomes "Munchkin Express" hauling kids up to their ski classes. A roller can be mounted on the rear for hill grooming.

#### Dozer

Owned by Meanyite [Bob Bentler](Bob-Bentler). This International Harvester TD6-61 (Diesel) was used to smooth out ski lesson terrain, prepare ground at Tombstone Canyon for laying culvert pipes and to grade roads.

#### Dino

This Logan Mfr. Corp. snow grooming machine was in use at the Snoqualmie ski area until the mid 1990's. Prior to its purchase by Meany it was refurbished at the factory in Colorado. It has a 6 cyl. diesel engine and is used to groom the accessible slopes at Meany and to plow the road towards the parking lot.

#### Mule

DR wheelbarrow with a 4 1/2 HP Tecumseh engine. With an aging Meany workparty volunteer base and youngsters not being too savvy with hard labor it became necessary to invest in this modern back saving machine.

#### Goat

DR Brush Cutter. Keeper: Dave Claar. This machine was purchased new and is used for brush control on ski terrain. With its 15 HP, 4 stroke Kawasaki engine and four forward and reverse gears it can devour shrubbery faster than 13 goats can.

#### Track Setter

Towed behind the "[Mouse](Mouse)" (snowmobile) it makes two parallel grooves in the snow, about 2 inches deep for cross country skiers, who enjoy the groovy skiing.

#### Peevee

Is used for nudging along or rolling logs, usually to provide better access for choker cables or chain saw. It is recommended not to operate this tool from the downhill side of a log.

#### Misery Whip (pre chainsaw era)

This 1/2 specimen used to be a two man felling saw used at Meany. You can make up your own story why there's only half of it left. Meanyite Mike Lonergan remembers the days of their use and might tell stories, if asked.

#### Swede Hook

This tool is used for carrying logs when machinery is not available. One or two persons may be on each side. Number of hooks and Swedes required depends on the size of logs and the strength of carriers.

#### Wedges

Used to persuade a tree to fall in the desired directoin by driving them into the backcut with the backside of an ax.

#### Maul

Designed for splitting firewood. The thin cutting edge penetrates the wood easily, and the thicker midsection forces the wood apart. The beefed up back can be beaten on with a sledge hammer. Note the curvaceous design as compared to a plain wedge.

#### Two Sided Ax

Was primarily used for cutting springboard notches and undercuts on trees to be felled. If one side gets dull the other can still be used. It also has a nice balanced feel. For the ambitious it can be used to cut two trees at the same time, one with the backswing and one with the foreswing.

#### Spurs and Belt

Accessories for climbing trees or wooden poles for limbing or installing stuff.

#### Fuel House

Built in 2001, it has two rooms, one for a 1500 gallon diesel tank for Dino, the hill grooming machine, and the other houses the gas tank for the tow hut engine.

#### Gas House

Gasoline refueling station for all our animals except Dino.

#### Propane Hut

Built in 2001. Tank capacity is 500 gallons and will last through a season. The tank replaces several smaller tanks, which were kept in the generator hut nearby and did not meet today's safety code requirements.

#### Tow Hut

Houses the driving machinery for Meany's "Mach Tow." Build in 1938. Present engine: 1960 6 cyl. 292 hp. Chevy. Total length of rope is 2500 feet. Length of uphill trip is about 1000 feet with about 420 feet elevation gain. Presently used top speed is 16 mph, as allowed by state authority. Previously the top speed was 19+ mph, but it could and occasionally was shifted to 30 mph. When propelled up the hill at such speeds it seems as if one was approaching the speed of soundâ€“hence the name "Mach Tow."<sup>[75th][]</sup>

#### Mouse

This heavy duty 2-speed snowmobile was bought new by Al Alleman and donated to Meany. It's used for errands, individual transportation to worksites, etc. and thrills and chills. [Dave Claar](Dave-Claar) uses the mouse to tow the track setter for the groomed X-Country trail starting just below the hut. Can't come out now. It hibernates in summer.

#### Generator Hut

This gasoline engine driven 5,000 watt generator is used for emergency power when our normal power fails us due to inclement weather, accident or maintenance problems. This unit does not start automatic but must be started manually.
