### History

#### 1978

One extra special Saturday night program was the dedication banquet for "Walt's Woods" with Master of Ceremonies Lee Heiser cleverly spicing the evening and a film on Walter shown by Bob Bentler. A huge cake shaped like a bald head contained a hidden cavity which was opened to reveal Walter's thoughts in the form of sayings on heart-shaped candies.<sup>[hr][]</sup>

#### 1979

Another notable weekend was the Leap Day Bonanza where Hildegarde Hamhocker of Tumbleweeds (played by [Bob Bentler](Bob-Bentler)) and Sadie Hawkins from Dogpatch (portrayed by [Norm Vigus](Norm-Vigus)) invaded to choose a mate from among the many Meany eligibles...Bob Bentler showed Super 8 movies of Walt and Norm to prove why they should be winners.<sup>[hr78][]</sup>
