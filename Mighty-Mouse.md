### History
#### 2020

MM was a Skandic SWT we purchased from a wanabe guide service in Wyoming with almost no hours. I hauled it from Wyoming to Meany. All paperwork was turned over to Dave Claar as it was purchased for his programs. He should have the more detailed information. --[Mike Lonergan](Mike-Lonergan)
