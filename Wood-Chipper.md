#### Sharpening & Maintenance

Hi Matt.  To answer your question:
New blades cost about $100 from DR and about $80 when on sale as they are
now.  You will need the model and serial number of the machine to get the
right blade Note: the machines are listed under my or Phyllis's name at DR.

To sharpen the blade cost about $10 and they can be sharpened about 10 -15
times before there is not enough of the blade to work well.  The blades are
quite hard and do not sharpen by hand well.  I get the blades sharpened at
the Eastside Saw Shop in Bellevue - 12880 Bel-Red Rd Bellevue WA
(425-861-7777).  It is the only place that I know near me that can sharpen
the blades.  Not all shops can sharpen the blades because the metal is so
hard.

If you get them sharpened be sure to mention it is for a chipper and not a
planner.  The difference is that they will sharpen out all the nicks for the
planner, if they don't know, and use up more metal resulting in fewer times
you can sharpen it.

You should also get new bolts and nuts and use the new bolts and nuts each
time you change out the blades.  I get the bolts and nuts from Tacoma Screw
which have locations in quite a few places.  There is one near me in
Kirkland 11200 120th Ave NE.  Be sure to get the right size.  The chippers
use different size bolts depending on the model (my machine uses 1-1/2 inch
bolt which should be the same as the Meany machine..

I have several blades and save the dull ones up until I get several dull
ones they take them in.

Hope this helps.
