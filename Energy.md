### History

#### 1928

The railroad supplied coal to Meany Lodge at inception. The coal was used in a "big hotel range in the kitchen" <sup>[ma56][]</sup>. The kitchen range weighted 1,700 pounds and was hauled up the hill with block and tackle. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

Gasoline Coleman lanterns furnished light <sup>[hw][], [ma56][]</sup>

#### 1937

A small water power lighting plant was developed by [Willard Johnston](Willard-Johnston) and [Jack Hossack](Jack-Hossack), Hut chairman. <sup>[ma37][]</sup>

#### 1939

Added gasonline motor-generator set for electric lights. Added wiring for electric lights in hut, replacing gasoline lanterns. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

a basement with furnace in place of the former pot-bellied stove in the middle of the living room. The furnace burns both wood and coal. <sup>[hw][], [ma91][]</sup>

#### 1946

By the time the first snowflake falls on the [Lane](Lane), Meany will boast a new light plant...and (attention, [Nashie](Nashie)!) a new stove in a freshly painted peasant kitchen. <sup>[ma46][]</sup>

#### 1948

the bin is filled with coal for baking Nashie's pies and cinnamon rolls...and enough wood to keep the hut warm for many evenings <sup>[ma48][]</sup>

#### 1949

Installed new propane range in kitchen. This replaced coal-fired range upon which 25 years of cooks have suffered. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1951

the most important is to transport the coal from rail to flat car and thence to the hut with the faithful aid of The [Beast](Beast) which draws our antiquated trailer. From the forest comes the clear ring of falling axes and busy saws as the fellows build up a winter's supply of wood for the furnace. <sup>[ma51][]</sup>

#### 1952

Mr. Morris of the gas company still wonders how, in a few hours of apparently complete disorganization, the new stove and heater were carried in; cylinders brought up and installed; everything put in working order; and his tools all returned to the box. <sup>[ma52][]</sup>

#### 1953

A new gas stove and water heater <sup>[ma53][]</sup>

#### 1960

Three different second-hand light plants have been used at Meany for lights since 1939. All of them ran! Meany has never been without lights.
- The Meany Lane is now lighted at night. Lights at top and bottom are produced by second-hand generators and voltage regulators attached to the rope; those in the center by a gasoline-electric generator known as the "turbo-encabulator." All equipment was bought at junk prices. No failures yet! <sup>[tp][]</sup>

#### 1962

Good use was made of the large numbers turning out for work parties by completely overhauling the light plant. <sup>[ma62][]</sup>

Puget Sound Power and Light ran a transmission line up the center of [North Slobbovia](North-Slobbovia), one of the better ski runs. They did this in the mistaken belief that they were using the Bonneville power right-of-way, whereas actually they were on Mountaineer property. The ensuing year was filled with negotiation and threats to physically remove the power line. It was finally settled in August 1963. Meany would grant an easement and PSPL Co. would place power line underground and cut the stumps on "North Slobbovia" flush with the ground. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1963

Construction of a power line from the Martin Station on the Northern Pacific Railroad tracks to the Hut was started after an agreement had been consummated with the railroad for power. Mountaineers built 600' of 2400 V single phase power line to R.R. terminus; kept motor-generator set as standby. <sup>[ma63][] [ma78][] [hw][]</sup>

p.137: The Legal Advisory Committee was involved in three important questions. The most time-consuming was the negotiation with the Puget Sound Power and Light Company over the right of way for power lines on the Meany ski hill. p.142: Puget Sound Power and Light, which initially constructed a power line across Meany property during the summer of 1962 without permission from the Mountaineers, has replaced the overhead power line with one that now runs underground.

#### 1966

Changed propane tanks from 400# to 200# size, used only to fuel kitchen stove.
<sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1974

Moved propane tanks to generator hut. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

## 1980

Power connection to BNRR interrupted by falling tree. Connection restored temporarily, but BNRR advises their power line over Stampede Pass is to be abandoned. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1981

Constructed power transmisison to connect Meany system to Puget Sound Power Line on South side of Meany property. ~500 ft. Transformers to convert supply at 7000v to 2400v. Meter at point of tie to supply line. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1982

Crews built a power line from Puget Sound Power line on [Lower Slobbovia](Lower-Slobbovia) to the lodge. This became necessary because last year a tree took out a power line and during the process of repair Burlington-Northern management discovered Meany Ski Hut was still getting power from the railroad. The power permit was cancelled but Burlington-Northern continued to supply power to the lodge during spring and summer of 1981 and until Meany could connect to Puget Sound Power. Thank you, Burlington-Northern! And thanks to [Carsten Lien](Carsten-Lien) for negotiating this arrangement. <sup>[ma82][]</sup>

#### 1985

Rewire all basement electric circuits all of which were overloaded. Installed new electric control panels and switches in pantry. Power supply to [Cat House](Cat-House) put underground. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1986

- Add dead end hardware on trees supporting power line between lodge and tows <sup>[hw][]</sup>
- Disconnects added at power pole at [Mach](Mach) tow
- Power lines were revised to include dead end hardware at all trees. <sup>[hr][]</sup>

#### 1989

Because of new code restrictions against buried fuel tanks, dug up 2 buried 500 gallon gasoline tanks used by "[Mach](Mach)". Cleaned, painted and reinstalled in two locations, one near [Cat House](Cat-House), one near [Tow Hut](Tow-Hut). Each station a 10' x 10' concrete block building, complete with wiring, plumbing and pump.<sup>[hw][]</sup>

Two aesthetically attractive concrete block houses were built to encase gas tanks above ground as the risk of rupture of underground tanks was considered too great. <sup>[hr][]</sup>

#### 2001

Constructed the [Propane Hut](Propane-Hut) to enclose a 500-gallon propane tank.<sup>[75th][]</sup>

#### 2017

Approximately 2017: replaced 500 gallon propane tank with 1000 gallon.

#### 2019

Replaced all florescent (tubes and A19) bulbs in the Lodge, Tow Hut, Cat House, and Zoo with LED bulbs. Should materially reduce electric consumption.
